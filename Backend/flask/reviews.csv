I got it and applied it was easy. I did have a lot of bubbles and I have been working them out. It was my fault I didn't properly get the dust off before hand. I really am enjoying this screen protector it has a nice feel to when you use fingers on it. I hope some of the bubbles die down after a few days but for the most part I am very happy with this protector!,1
I have it in my kitchen and I use it to play music watch shows while cooking. It’s great for recipes. I already it connected with my door bell so if someone rings my doorbell I can see who is at my door. It’s amazing very satisfied with my purchase.,1
"I couldn't decide between the Echo Show 8 or 10, but went with the Echo Show 10 based on the speakers as I wanted a good music source to go to sleep with. Also nice to have the news feed, temperature, and weather available. Setup with very straightforward. The manual is very sparse but I found that all the questions I had were answered with a quick Google Search. I particularly enjoy how well Amazon Music integrates with the system, providing plenty of the music I love to lull me into la la land. Yes, the Echo Show 10 was significantly more expensive than the model 8, but the extra screen space and better speakers were what I wanted so it was worth the price. The only feature I felt I didn't need was the rotation, but that was easy to turn off with a simple Alexa request, and I never know when I might find it useful in the future. All things considered, I'm glad I bought it. BTW, kudos to the person responsible at Amazon for designing the packaging. What particularly impressed me was the addition of a paper strap by which you can pull the Echo Show product box out of the fitted Amazon external box. Made it really easy to get it out without turning the box over and shaking it. Also liked the cover they had on the screen, a nice touch. This is one of the better designed product boxes than I've seen in a while.",1
"Muy Buena resolución, excelente sonido y una de las mejores ventajas es que cuando estás viendo algo o simplemente una videollamada nunca te pierdes de nada porque la pantalla te sigue a donde te muevas. Recomendado 100%",1

Love the sound. The functionality is great as well.,1
I’ve owned most of the Alexa’s…but I’m finding this one so much more entertaining…it’s nice to have it turn toward me…making it seem as though we are actually conversing…and even though there’s information flashing on the screen most of the time…my eyesight is just fuzzy enough so I don’t find it bothersome…hopefully Amazon won’t enlarge the font..lol….overall it’s a lovely resource… and will last as long as the one it replaced which was five years..,1
I am a Siri guy but I love this because I can drop in on my Mother who is in a Elderly home. Makes it easy to see her and communicate with her. I highly recommend it for that purpose,1
"The neatest thing about this is that you can make calls on it and drop ins are video type calls, but you have to make sure that the person you are calling also has one. It’s great for watching movies on prime and YouTube but I did want to say I really love it. My husband likes to listen to some of the news and I think he likes it also, because he’s playing with it all the time.",1
The media could not be loaded. Excelente emocionado con mis hijos,1
